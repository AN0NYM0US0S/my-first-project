# Big Market Sales Prediction

This project aims to analyze and predict sales for a retail dataset using data analysis techniques and data preprocessing. The dataset includes information about items, their attributes, store types, and their corresponding sales figures. Missing values are handled, and categorical data is analyzed to ensure data completeness for further modeling.

Project Overview

The project performs:

Data Collection and Exploration: Understanding the structure and quality of the data.

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values using mean and mode imputation.

Categorical Data Analysis: Analyzing and filling missing data in categorical columns.

Preparing the dataset for further predictive modeling (regression tasks).



---

Dataset Description

The dataset consists of 12 columns and 8523 rows, with both numerical and categorical features.

Columns in the Dataset

Technologies Used

The following Python libraries are used in this project:

Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy: Numerical operations.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.

Warnings: To suppress irrelevant warnings.

Data Preprocessing Steps

1. Handling Missing Values:

For Item_Weight (numerical), the mean value is used to fill missing data.

For Outlet_Size (categorical), the mode (most frequent value) is used.

Mode values are determined based on Outlet_Type.




2. Filling Missing Data:

Missing values in Item_Weight are replaced with the column's mean value.

Missing values in Outlet_Size are replaced with the mode value for each Outlet_Type.



3. Verification:

The dataset is checked to ensure all missing values are handled.

Installation

Pre-requisites:

Python (3.x)

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn


Steps:

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/AN0NYM0US0S/my-first-project.git

cd my-first-project


2. Install dependencies:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn


3. Ensure the dataset file bigmarket.csv is available in the project directory.




---

Usage

1. Run the script to perform data cleaning and preprocessing:

python data_analysis.py


2. Output will include:

Initial dataset information and missing values.

Handling of missing values (mean/mode imputation).

A cleaned dataset with no missing data.



3. Sample Outputs:

Initial Missing Values:

Item_Weight: 1463 missing
Outlet_Size: 2410 missing

After Filling Missing Values:

All missing values successfully filled!

Future Improvements

Include feature engineering to create new meaningful variables.

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) with detailed visualizations.

Build regression models to predict Item_Outlet_Sales more accurately.

Tune hyperparameters for machine learning models for better performance.
